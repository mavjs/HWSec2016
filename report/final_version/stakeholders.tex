\section{Stakeholders}
The PRS has different stakeholders. The government is involved for the purpose of regulating the fuel consumption of the inhabitants. Petrol companies are involved for providing the fuel and for modifying their pumping installations to accommodate the PRS. They typically want low cost and low interaction/maintenance systems. The last stakeholder would be car owners, these are the end-users of the PRS and the owner of the petrol card. They typically want easy-to-use systems and a certain degree of privacy.
